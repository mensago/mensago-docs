== Introduction

The effort to minimize trust in infrastructure might imply that underlying transport mechanisms donâ€™t matter. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Mensago transport protocols have been designed to maximize privacy and prevent bad behavior. However, sometimes it is beneficial to completely avoid standard server transport.

Although there are already other formats and utilities which can encrypt files, this method greatly simplifies the processes of key management while retaining security. For example, transporting 7-zip archives also requires communicating the password. Using PGP requires exchange of keys. This format is designed to be used in conjunction with the Mensago platform. Thus, encrypting a file for offline use by a specific person could be just a matter of having that person in your address book and running a command like `ejd_encrypt 'bob/example.com' secretfile.ejd file1.txt file2.jpg` or a few clicks in a graphical application.

== Conventions

Software using this design document may be independent of the Mensago platform, but it is expected that such software will utilize conventions from the platform.

* Base85 encoding described in RFC1924[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1924] is used to ensure user data is JSON-compliant.
* Cryptographic hashes and keys use the Cryptostring format.
* Hashes of cryptographic keys are generated on the Encoded String of a key, not just the binary data of the key itself.

Cryptostrings are a string format consisting of prefix, a colon for a separator, and Base85-encoded binary data. The prefix consists of 1 to 15 capital ASCII letters or dashes. No other characters are permitted. The prefix is used to indicate the algorithm used for hash or key. As of this writing, the standard prefixes are `CURVE25519`, `ED25519`, `XSALSA20`, `BLAKE2B-256`, and `SHA2-256`.

== JSON Key Storage Format

Not all environments will have a Mensago profile available. In these environments, encryption keys may be stored in individual JSON Key files. The files are standard JSON using a schema which matches the following example:

[source,json]
----
{
	"PublicKey": "CURVE25519:{+{hFKn?1;VDA1CxlYzQVKzVXbd#k@X@2$3@m9PS",
	"PrivateKey": "CURVE25519:eT3h0s;Z)t8%D~hiT1i|E&zy4f8;bxwK&M%i(*UH"
}
----

The `PublicKey` field is required. While the `PrivateKey` field is optional, the key itself is necessary for decrypting EJD files. Keys stored in this manner have the extensions `.jkey`. Only one keypair may be stored per file. The user is responsible for handling the keyfile itself with the proper care.

== Offline Data Format

An offline file is even more minimalistic than a standard Mensago storage file. It is intended to convey as little information about the file except for the requirements to decrypt it. Only the key which matches the `KeyHash` field will be able to decrypt the associated payload. The hash is generated from the Base85-encoded public key used to encrypt the payload. Files using this format are expected to use the `.ejd` (**E**ncrypted **J**SON **D**ocument) file extension.

[source,json]
----
{
	"Item": {
		"Version" : "1.0",
		"KeyHash" : "BLAKE2B-256:uWpi?&AVVKIo&m;O2r=i4tKT|KJ!o~fI0|@l};li",
		"Key": "XSALSA20:ihbCfWuF8`7x}bk7vBjJel?p52RB8ALs3MNy)CSw"
	},
	"Payload" : "p!!IiyNgX$CYU+3Hqqb}9wng#^S^-k({8$Ou~NMjT?o6-ARS}uOcGZE1~>_2pLWQt={W1(?L)v&kT*;img18NVf|blhL*_lo-)Th@gQ`vkGy<4MS+M*`A5fI!=U+J;!l1(uhtuR_F>4);OpvDmSITh+|pDcN&i)61Y^n+SLO25gZ>4g&Au3adOrg}+kO%c#E@Db%jpN0rh}$e9Bk;7"
}
----

Version:: The API version of the data file. Until the platform reaches official 1.0 release status, this is set to `1.0`.

KeyHash:: Hash of the public key used to encode the secret key in the `Key` field. Note that this hash is of the Base85-encoded key, its algorithm prefix, and the colon separator, so if an Curve25519 key is `12345678`, the hash is of the string `+CURVE25519:F)}kWH8wXm+`.

Key:: The randomly-generated secret key used to encrypt the payload. The raw binary key has been encrypted using the public key which corresponds to the hash kept in the `KeyHash` field. This encrypted result was Base85-encoded and prefixed with the algorithm used to encrypt the payload. This secret key can only be decrypted by the private key which corresponds to said public key.

Payload:: This field contains the actual data intended for transport. It is encrypted by the secret key stored in the `Key` field and the result is Base85 encoded. The unencrypted contents of the payload field are also JSON structured text. Multiple files may be attached. Binary data is expected to be Base85-encoded. A sample unencrypted payload is listed below:

[source,json]
----
[
	{
		"Type" : "file",
		"Name" : "foobar.png",
		"Data" : "iBL{Q4GJ0x0000DNk~Le0000A0000A2nGNE0F5%wy#N3J1am@3R0s$N2z&@+hyVZp7)eAyR2Y?G{Qv*|e+D7|6ETWL6;e+j0BM>85Q>cpXaE2J07*qoM6N<$f&"
	},
	{
		"Type" : "file",
		"Name" : "somehaiku.txt",
		"Data" : "Q)OjqAa8CUXlZ9?AYx&1Wgv8NVQFl03R7!&EplaMY-M9~X>MmAc4=>HWpr~2O>cE>bYW?3Ep%^iAZlfIWo&Z_3JL"
	}
]

The payload is expected to be minified before encryption to minimize overhead.

== Offline Message Format

EJD files can be used to transport Mensago messages, as well. When messages are packaged for transport, the fields are slightly different. 

[source,json]
----
[
	{
		"Type" : "message",
		"Name" : "0001.offmsg",
		"Signature" : "ED25519:vp6R*W==)9>Us`MA!pz>7yyT&2{I&;`8hQmP<I2uJqu*<OA`O}!a^*e!W5dkVJ%_~V>KQpl;wN+#kXe)",

	}
]

The entry type is `message` instead of `file` and also includes `Signature` and `KeyHash` fields, described below. The value of the `Name` field is a suggestion for the extraction utility and exists primarily for differentiating one message from another. Extraction utilities MAY ignore the `Name` field, but any messages saved to disk SHOULD utilize the `.offmsg` extension. The `Data` field for offline messages contains the base85-encoded JSON code for the message.

The signature may be generated with the user's Contact Request Signing Key or Primary Signing Key, and the signature itself is based on a minified version of the message's JSON data so that whitespace is not a factor. The `KeyHash` field contains a hash of the Base85-encoded verification key corresponding to the signing key used. 

A slight variation of the standard JSON schema is used for offline messages. Offline messages lack the `To`, `CC`, and `BCC` field and a different `Type` field value. The delivery-related fields are omitted because the user is responsible for transport and delivery of the offline message. Multiple messages may be sent using this format. Each message is its own dictionary of data fields in the same way that a file transported this way has its own set of fields. An example of a sample offline message is shown below:


[source,json]
