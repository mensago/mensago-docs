*Status:* Draft +
*Abstract:* Mensago note structure

== Description

It would be completely silly to leave out notetaking abilities on the Mensago platform, given how trivial it would be to implement and how useful it would be.

== Payload Structure

=== Sample User Note

=== Note Fields

.Required Fields
- _Type_ - This field is required for all payloads. It defines the type of payload.

- _Version_ - The messaging API version.

- _Created_ - The UTC date and time of when the note was created. The date MUST be sent using
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] basic (compact) format. The time MUST be sent in the format HHMMSS. One space MUST be used to separate the two as in the following example: `YYMMDD HHMMSS`.

- _Updated_ - The time the note was last updated. This uses the same format as `created`.

- _Title_ - A string up to 100 characters in length. The characters MUST be valid printable UTF-8 characters or a space. Note that while the field is required, the field itself MAY be empty.

- _Body_ - MSTM-formatted text of any length. Escapement of content for JSON compliance is required.

- _Group_ - The group in which the note may be found. The default value for `group` should be ``default''.

.Optional Fields
- _Tags_ - A list of strings containing UTF-8 user-defined tags.

- _Attachments_ - A list of dictionaries containing attached data using the same format as Mensago messages.

=== Note Content

With notes being merely cloud-synchronized text files, there isnâ€™t much to be said about them. The body content may contain UTF-8 encoded plain text or MSTM-formatted text.
